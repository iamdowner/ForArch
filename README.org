Using [[https://nixos.org/][nix]] for +reproducible packages+ everything I can

** Install

1. Enable flakes
2. =git clone https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager.git ~/somewhere=
3. [[https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.html#sec-flakes-standalone][Install home manager]] (with flakes)
4. Configure in [[./nixpkgs/flake.nix][flake.nix]]
5. Remove =.git= and make it your own

Some configurations are not in nix yet (=.config/=), you can sync it using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][Stow]].
